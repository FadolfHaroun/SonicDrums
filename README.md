# SonicDrums
a simple drumApp with sfx from the old sonic racing game...i used buttons and added OnclickListener on them and the sounds using the Depricated SoundPool
Added the sfx make a folder called "raw" and copy them there.
Note:
-i didnt upload all the project files because its size is more than 30mb.so you go make a new project.
-Make a new project then go to MainActivity.java file then go to MainActivity class replace anything in it with my MainActivity(class)content...DONT COPY THE PACKAGE LINE.
-open your activity_main.xml file and replace its content with my "activity_main.xml"file.
-RUN THE PROGRAM :)
